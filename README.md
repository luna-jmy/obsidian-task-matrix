# Obsidian Task Matrix ⚡

A powerful Obsidian plugin that transforms your Markdown tasks into visual task dashboards with List, GTD, and Eisenhower Matrix views.

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Three Complementary Views

| View | Best For | Key Benefit |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **📋 List View** | Comprehensive task overview | Search and browse all tasks |
| **📥 GTD Flow** | Workflow management | Visual Kanban with Inbox → In Progress → Waiting → Done |
| **🔳 Eisenhower Matrix** | Priority decisions | Urgency vs. importance at a glance |

### 🎯 Core Capabilities

- **Visual Task Dashboard**: See all your vault's tasks in one place
- **Smart Task Parsing**: Supports standard Obsidian task formats including:
  - Task status: `- [ ]`, `- [/]`, `- [-]`, `- [x]`
  - Priorities: `⏫` (Highest), `🔼` (High), `🔽` (Low), `⏬` (Lowest)
  - Dates: `📅` Due, `🛫` Start, `⏳` Scheduled, `✅` Done, `➕` Created
  - Task IDs: `🆔` for dependency tracking
  - Dependencies: `⛔` indicates a task is blocked by another
  - Tags: Any `#tag` including `#waiting`, `#doing`, `#blocked`

### 🧠 Smart Automation

- **Auto GTD Classification**: Tasks are automatically categorized based on status, tags, and dates
- **Eisenhower Quadrants**: Auto-sorted by priority and due date urgency
- **Dependency Tracking**: Blocked tasks (with unfinished dependencies) are visually marked
- **Drag & Drop**: Move tasks between GTD columns or Eisenhower quadrants to auto-update tags

### 🎛️ Task Actions

Each task card provides quick actions:
- ✓ Complete/Uncomplete
- ▶ Start (set to in-progress)
- ✕ Cancel
- ✎ Edit (modify description, priority, dates, ID, dependencies)
- 🗑 Delete
- Click to open task in file

### ⚙️ Settings

- **Scan Folder**: Limit task indexing to a specific vault folder
- **Default View**: Choose which view opens first (List/GTD/Eisenhower)
- **Include Completed**: Toggle visibility of completed/cancelled tasks
